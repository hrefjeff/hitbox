# Hitbox Journal

## Day 6 (Aug 11th, 2019)

I created a battle lounge and lilCreepySleepy a Birdie player joined.
We went on for at least 2 hours in a FT3 format.
His Birdie messed me up.
However, he primarily used Honda.

The drills and warm-up activies are starting to pay off.
I can now switch sides freely and not be disoriented.

### _Auto spacing whiff punishes_

Ryu's st.mk is a useful tool to space your opponent just far enough away from you to whiff punish their next attack.
I'll try to include more of this in my game play as well.

### _Miscellaneous thoughts_

I want to learn some VT1 setups.
After EX.donkey kick the opponent can't back-rise.
That leaves only focusing on quick-rise and normal rise.
In the corner, I know you can do ex.jordan -> dash -> st.hp (+1 ob, +5 on hit, CC counter hit)

## Day 5 (Aug 10th, 2019)

I mainly stayed in training mode today.
Played maybe 1 casual match and then got off.
On top of the regular warm-ups, I developed a side-switch drill as well.
Cross-up warmups:
  1. 50 empty jump cross up -> cr.lk -> cr.lp -> h.dp
  1. 50 j.mk -> cr.lk -> cr.lp -> h.dp (this one you have the option to cross up)
  1. 50 h.tatsu -> backdash -> cr.mk -> ex.fireball -> v-trigger cancel -> dash -> dp

## Day 4 (Aug 9th, 2019)

I played at my local today in Huntsville Alabama.
Lucky Dice Cafe from ~6pm-11pm.
My focus was entirely on landing my combos.

I noticed cross-cut DP's became much easier.
At the end of the night I noticed I didn't really have trouble with the 4 to 3 input anymore.

### _Side switching_

I found it difficult to immediately adjust when I ended up on the other side of my opponent.
An example would be if I jumped and crossed up an opponent.
I'd freeze up, drop the combo, or start mashing.
I'll have to develop a warm-up for this soon and practice it.

## Day 3 (Aug 8th, 2019)

### _Character Selection_

I decided to go with Ryu.
He's a basic bitch with a moveset that overlaps with a majority of the cast.
I believe that will help me be able to transition easily to whatever character I'd like to play next.
The original plan was to either learn Zeku or Honda.
In the interest of learning hitbox I thought it best to start with an easier character.

### _Today's Summary_

I could tell I felt a little more comfortable with the inputs.
Switching between 4 and 3 has become easier.
Warm up with SFV currently:
  1. 10 laps (dashing from one side of the stage to the other)
  1. Special move warmup:
      1. 50 fireballs each side
      1. 50 tatsu's each side
      1. 50 cr.mk -> fireball each side
      1. 50 donkey kicks each side
  1. Combo warmup:
      1. cr.lk -> cr.lp -> h.dp
      1. st.lp -> st.lp -> st.lk -> lk.donkey kick
      1. st.mp -> st.mp -> tatsu
      1. st.mp -> st.mp -> ex.jordan kick -> h.dp
      1. j.hk -> st.mp -> cr.hp -> hk.tatsu (mk.tatsu if close to corner)
      1. 50 ex.fireball -> vt.activate -> dash -> h.dp

I still mash though whenever I haven't thought through a combo.
Need to stop doing that!

## Day 2 (Aug 7th, 2019)

Everytime I waited on something today I practiced my 4+3 inputs.
Whether it was waiting on food, waiting at a red light, or waiting for an ad on a video to be done.

### _Taking Densetsu's advice_

I'm applying the first lesson by slowing my inputs down in order to become familiar with the motions and gradually speeding up.

Also, I started playing Hollow Knight.
It's a super dope side scrolling game and fits the hitbox perfectly.
I noticed movement became easier within 30 minutes of playing.

## Day 1 (Aug 6th, 2019)

I tuned in to <a href="https://twitter.com/PianoDensetsu" target="_blank">Piano Densetsu's</a> stream.
He had some great advice on getting started with hitbox.
I asked him the question, "What do you wish you would have known when you first started using the hitbox?"
His reply was that he wish he knew more of how to practice.
He explained that when he doesn't have access to his hitbox,
he rested his hand on a flat surface and practiced lifting each finger up one at a time.
After a couple of days doing this should get more fluid (especially for the commonly problematic ring finger).
I've been doing this off and on but I plan on making this more consistent.

Also, he stressed on practicing clean inputs.
So don't rush the inputs.
If I don't get something at first, I'll slow it down and steadily increase the speed.

Lastly, he said play a side scroller game and practice navigating menus.
You don't always have to just play street fighter to learn how to hitbox.

### _Biggest problem I found today_

I found out that walking and blocking on the player 2 side is hard for me.
The input is switching between 4 and 3 (or L and D+R).
I notice when I lift up my ring finger, my index finger is the first to go down followed by my middle finger.

## Precursor

I've played on both pad and stick in the past.
I used to play guitar for about a year so my left hand has some muscle memory of piano'ing inputs.
I played trumpet and saxaphone too so my right hand has some muscle memory too.
For all intents and purposes of this journal I'll just give my experience on what I'm working on and how I'm going about getting better with a HB.
